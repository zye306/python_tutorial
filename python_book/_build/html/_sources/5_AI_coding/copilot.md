# Introduction to GitHub Copilot

GitHub Copilot is a paid add-on from GitHub. It is free for students, but you need to get access by signing up for the [GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack). Others with academic afilliations, like professors and postdocs, can also get free access to GitHub Copilot by applying for the [GitHub Teacher Benefits](https://education.github.com/teachers). If you are not affiliated with an educational institution, however, you will need to get a paid subscription to GitHub Copilot in order to use it.
